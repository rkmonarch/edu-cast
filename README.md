# Edupad

Edupad provides an interactive no-code platform that allows users to create a NFT collection on Educhain network. It empowers creators to build thriving web3 communities on Educhain. We desire to provide a launchpad that simplifies community, monetization, and growth. It also provides a developer tool to airdrop NFTs in batches just by providing a recipients list. This is powerful and enhances the adaptability of an easy-to-go launchpad.
